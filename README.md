### Tinn-R doc

The Tinn-R User guide (and eBook) are completely written in *LaTeX* 
and the idea behind this to be available on GitHub is that it has contributions from multiple users.

If you find something that you would like to include or improve: please, fell free to make it better.

This have been developing under both OS: *Windows* and *Linux*.

Under *Windows*: we have been using *Tinn-R* as editor and *TexLive* as compiler.

Under *Linux*: we have been using *Vim* (with *LaTeX-Box plugin*) as editor and *TexLive* as compiler.

The **source code** of this software is available at:

The **stable version** of this software is available at:
- https://tinn-r.org/en/
- https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinn-r/

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Minor bug with match bracket was corrected.

\end{itemize}

        <CTRL + ADD> key (numeric keypad)
        will insert/replace text with the attribution symbol '->';

        <CTRL + SUBTRACT> key (numeric keypad)
        will insert/replace text with the attribution symbol '<-'.
      \end{verbatim}
    \end{footnotesize}

  \item Search/Replace was improved. It is possible now to decide if the
    occurrence will be, or not, replaced.

    \begin{footnotesize}
      \begin{verbatim}
        Temporarily, and until a better solution is found, to work properly,
        if the window is horizontally split the Search/Replace must be  made
        at the bottom (main) window, because if it's at the top window (secondary)
        it doesn't question the confirmation to each substitution of the text occurrence.
        If the window is vertically split, the Search/Replace must be made at the
        left window (the right window does not question the confirmation to each
        substitution of the occurrence). For both, any key will synchronize the split windows.
      \end{verbatim}
    \end{footnotesize}

  \item Now Tinn-R can initiate (Tolls/Initiate ...) and close (Tolls/Close ...)
    preferred RGui. For the first, the path of preferred RGui must be previously
    set (Options/Application options).
  \item A new Tinn to \RR{} option was implemented: \textit{Help selected word}.
  \item Interface (appearance and icons) was reformulated.
  \item Tinn-R hotkeys' interface was reformulated. Now it is possible to choose
    the desired hotkeys to main actions.
  \item On the menu \textit{Options/Application options} it is possible to choose
    the appearance to Tinn-R like WinXP.
  \item It is possible to get the positions of Tinn-R toolbars (preserved) when
    application exits, and restore the next time it is started.
  \item On the (Edit/Copy formatted) it is possible to copy the native format
    and exported it in RTF, HTML and TeX format.
  \item Improvements were made to the highlighting.
